irond Release 0.3.4 - 27.08.12

* Bugfix: Use subject instead of issuer id when doing 
  	  certificate based authentication

* Updated keystore and irond certificate (now valid for 10 years)

irond Release 0.3.0 - 21.12.11

* Bugfix: Proper handling of terminal-identifier-types.
          irond now checks validity of the given string.

* Added irond.comm.rawlog=[true|false] in order to allow
  for raw logging of received requests. See
  irond.properties.orig and log4j.properties for details.

* Added irond.xml.validate=[true|false] in order to turn
  XML schema validation on or off.
  Further added irond.xml.schema.0=file.xsd to specify the
  XML schema to be used for validation. See
  irond.properties.orig for details.

* Rewrote MAP graph data structures to allow for optimizationas
  mentioned below. Decouple MAP graph structure from actual
  content in the MAP graph.

* Rewrote subscription management:
  Differential results for PollResults were determined by the
  results of two searches. One search on the old state of the
  MAP graph and one search on the new state of the MAP graph.
  This is very expensive, both in terms of runtime of the
  searches alone and further in terms of the number of matching
  operations that have to be done on metadata objects.
  
  The new implementation now holds the state of a subscriptions's
  search-graph and included metadata objects in the MAP graph itself
  in order to make the determination of differential results less
  expensive.

  irond's performance managing subscription updates was significantly
  improved compared to 0.2.4.


irond Release 0.2.4 - 12.10.11

* Adapt the construction of PollResults to what will be expected
  from the Specification. Most recent metadata comes last in PollResult.
  This involved quite some changes.

* Refactor the horrible SubscriptionService while changing the ordering
  of metadata.

* Update log4j httpcore libraries

* Bugfix: Searcher failed if two different links produced the same
           hashCode()

* Bugfix: Searcher would not traverse links already traveled, even if the
          depth was smaller than in the first round. This could occur
	  occur with circles in the MAP graph.

* Bugfix: Remove illegal subscription update optimization.


irond Release 0.2.3 - 06.07.11

* Bugfix: Setting max-poll-result-size was only possible for a
          MAPC while creating its first session.

* Bugfix: Exceeding the max-size of a single subscription does
          not lead to removal of all subscriptions of a MAPC, but
	  only of those, that actually exceeded their max-size.

* Bugfix: After PollResultsTooBig occurred, no pollResults would
          be sent to the MAPC until a new session would be
	  established.

* Bugfix: Unmarshalling of the XML request could result in a
          ClassCastException if the document didn't start with
	  the Envelope.

* Bugfix: Link.equals() was not symmetric.

* Bugfix: Do not set the session-id of a MAPC as name attribute
          in the searchResult.

* Bugfix: Race condition: a MAPC could create a new session with a
          channel attached which was closed during the new session
	  call.

* Small Performance Improvement:
  - Remove some manual string parsing and use Transformer properties
    for W3cXmlMetadata.

  - Replace newDocumentBuilder() calls in the unmarshalling process
    with ThreadLocal variables.

* Another channel behavior change: Send AccessDenied error whenever
  a MAPC uses an old channel.

* Print a warning if Content-Length field was not found. Things
  will most likely break.

* Set an errorString for errorResults contained in pollResults.


irond Release 0.2.2 - 16.05.2011

* Sizes of SearchResults and PollResults are now determined during
  creation of results, e.g. during a search. For SearchResults the
  size was checked after the comlete result was marshalled.

* Size limits given by MAPCs are honored now, hopefully.

* Remove unused namespace declarations on metadata objects.

* Refactoring to handle PollResults as Events in comparison to
  processing them during the callback. Should improve performance a
  bit when multiple MAPC are subject to new PollResults after a
  single publish operation.

* Defer the marshalling of responses until all critical IF-MAP logic is
  done. Allows for parallel marshalling of responses and should result
  in better performance when multiple clients access the MAPS in
  parallel.

* Refactoring to remove instanceof checks from the EventProcessor class.
  Either by using double-dispatch, or moving them in a more responsible
  class.

* Return purgePublisherReceived even if the publisher in question didn't
  exist.

* Racing in SessionTimer could lead to a situation where a timed out
  session was not removed.

* Renaming of the Marshalling/Unmarshalling classes.

* Search Algorithm: Return on identifiers/links which have been visited
  before. Avoids traversing cycles over and over again.

* Use JAXB XML Validation in order to detect bogus requests. Requires
  schema documents in the folder schema/ to be available.

* Renamed InvalidSessionId back to InvalidSessionID as the schema defines
  it.


irond Release 0.2.1 - 21.04.2011

* ip-address validation fixed. Negative and zero leading bytes were allowed

* Validation of hip-hit identieties. Simple IPv6 checks

* Remove unknown ifmap-* prefixes from metadata when MAPCs send them

* More or less random session-id's 

* Check if namespace declaration for filter strings are given
  (still no real filter syntax validation)

* Treat device identifier with aik-name as deprecated and respond with
  an InvalidIdentifier error message if a MAPC makes use of the aik-name

* Fixed the 'a single ExecutorServer per Timer' bug

* Fixed horrible memoryleak in relation with unmarshalling

* Changed key-pair for irond (new keystore + new certificate)

* Build a publisher-id for an unknown MAPC only using the common name (CN)
  of the certificate or the basic authentication username

* Fixed sanity check which backfired on us when deleting metadata which
  was added in the same publish request

* Fixed timer bugs

* InvalidSessionID -> InvalidSessionId renaming

* Better detection of failing channels, either SSRC or ARC

* Fixed search algorithm. Failed when identifiers had multiple links
  attached.

* Restored channel/session management to the behavior of the 0.1.x
  versions. MAPC are allowed to change their SSRC/ARC without closing
  the old one. Usage of the old channel is not allowed.

* SearchResultTooBig -> SearchResultsTooBig renaming

* If MAPC tries to use session-id of another MAPC send him
  InvalidSessionId, not AccessDenied

* Support for gzip requests and replies. Pretty ugly.

* Simple authorization model:
  - authorization.properties allows for the configuration of
    read-only clients. (see README)

* Add synchronization for Events other than RequestChannelEvents
  (This went undetected, for us at least...)

* Tons of refactoring
  - Use ExecutorService implementations where possible (now everywhere?)
  - Unify authentication and certificate-based authenticaton 
  - ChannelThread refactoring (still a mess...)


irond Release 0.2.0 - 09.02.2011

* Rewritten communication layer based on irond-0.1.x
